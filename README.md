# Health-Monitoring-System
Health monitoring is an essential problem in today’s world. Due to lack of proper
health monitoring, patients suffer from serious health issues. There are lots of IoT
devices that can monitor the health of patients over the internet. Health experts are
also taking advantage of these smart devices to keep an eye on their patients. 

With
tons of new healthcare technology start-ups, IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way we interact with
technology. 

IOT-based patient health monitoring system is a generic term given to any
medical equipment that has internet capability and can measure one or more health
data of a patient who is connected to the device such as heartbeat, body temperature, blood pressure, ECG, Pulse rate etc. Our device measures temperature, blood
oxygen and heart rate. 

The equipment can record, transmit and alert if there is any
abrupt change in the patient’s health. In this project, we have developed an IoT-based
health monitoring system that uses Arduino and various sensors to measure vital health
parameters such as SpO2, BPM, and temperature. The system is designed to continuously monitor the patient’s health and send the data to Thingspeak for remote access
and analysis.

#For Execution

User needs to have Arduino IDE to run all micro-controller codes.
User needs a ThingsSpeak account.
User needs to setup all the hardware components like - Arduino board as micro-controller, 2 sensors namely - LM35 for temperature, MAX30100 for heart rate and blood oxygen level.
